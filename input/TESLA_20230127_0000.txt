Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O, TSLA US ) Top Pick
Autos & Shared Mobility / United States of America

In recent days, I’ve asked several dealers and automotive experts if they’ve ever
seen a car company cut prices by 13 to 20% across the vast majority of its
product range in one move. Nobody can think of a precedent. Some clients
bemoan Tesla’s move as upsetting customers who recently paid far higher prices
for the exact same car. But we've seen this before… just 110 years ago. When
Henry Ford introduced the Model T and re-invented mass manufacturing, prices
of automobiles declined even more sharply. I reckon someone who paid 825
hard-earned US dollars for a Model T ‘Runabout’ in 1909 would have been
mildly perturbed to know that a few years later, in 1913, the same model would
sell for 40% less.
Pre-Model T cars cost around $80k (in today's dollars) on avg. Prior to the
introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908, gasoline-powered automobiles were
rather limited in use and extremely expensive. In the year 1907 (the last full year
prior to the Model T intro), there were 255 carmakers in the US (223 US-owned
and 32 foreign, according to ‘Motor’ magazine). The average price of a gasoline
car at the time was $2,834, or nearly $80k in 2023 dollars. There were 43k
vehicles produced in 1907 for an average production per carmaker of just 169
vehicles per year.
Deflation transformed the automotive competitive landscape and drove out
much of industry. By 1929 there were 44 surviving automobile manufacturers in
the United States with 80% of sales accounted for by General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler.

The Model T entry level ‘Runabout’ cost $825 in 1909 (around $24k/unit in
today's dollars), or less than 1/3 the price of the average car at the time. But
higher volumes and the moving assembly line brought far greater deflation in
the price of the automobile from there. The price of a Model T ‘Runabout’ fell to
$525 by 1913 ($13.5k in today’s dollars) and $395 by 1920. By 1925 the average
price of a Model T Runabout was $260 ($3,790 in today’s dollars) which was
around 1/20th of the average inflation adjusted price of a car in 1907.

Source: Morgan Stanley Research. Model T 'Runabout' price in today's dollars declined from $24/unit in 1909 to $3,790 by 1925.

It wasn’t the automobile or even the Model T itself that moved horse drawn
carriages off of the road, it was innovation in manufacturing that drove dramatic
levels of deflation. Henry Ford introduced mass manufacturing in his Highland
Park, Michigan factory in 1910 and his world-changing moving assembly in 1913.
Taking nothing away from Tesla or the ever-growing number of EV players
entering the market every month, we have not truly had the equivalent
revolution in high volume manufacturing for EVs at this point. Have we finally
reached the 'step change' in EV/Battery manufacturing? We look forward to
seeing many of you at the Tesla Investor Day in Austin March 1st.
Tesla's recent price cuts move their products into mainstream car territory. Last
night, I comparison shopped a 2023 Tesla Model Y Long Range with a Toyota
RAV4 Hybrid in stock at a dealership 2 miles up the road. According to Tesla’s
website, the Model Y lists for $53,490 or $45,990 including the $7,500 IRA tax
credit (assuming income threshold eligibility). The 2023 RAV4 Hybrid Premium
2

has an MSRP of $41,148 but is on sale for the ‘SmartPath’ price of $45,147 (like
many cars sold in the US recently, the dealer is charging above MSRP). The 2023
RAV4 Hybrid Limited (41/38 mpg highway/city with 0-60mph acceleration of 5.7
seconds) MSRP is $43,293 but sells for the ‘SmartPath’ price of $46,292. Perhaps
if we got to the dealership we may have been able to haggle for a better price.
Perhaps not. Toyota inventory is still so low these days.

While it’s still early days following the Tesla price cuts, we believe history will
reflect upon this time as the moment when changes in design, manufacturing
technology, and scale enabled profound deflation in the price of EVs. Potential
changes to industry composition and market share may take years to play out.
But we believe the EV forecasts and manufacturing plans of competing EV
players (startup and legacy) may potentially need to be fundamentally reconceived.
Tesla Model Y ($45,990 after $7,500 tax incentive) vs. Toyota RAV4 Hybrid ($43,293
MSRP): Same neighborhood of price - which is better value?

▪ A double-fly-wheel. We believe TSLA can

400

leverage its cost leadership in EVs to
aggressively expand its user base and over
time generate a higher % of revenue from
recurring/high-margin software & services.
Services drives the upside. We forecast
Tesla's services EBITDA to account for 13%
of total EBITDA by 2030 & ~32% by 2040.
Includes: FSD, infotainment, upgrades,
charging, maintenance, telematics, etc.
Valuation supportive vs. tech. Including
Services, Energy & Insurance in our forecast,
at $220, Tesla trades at ~10x 2030 EBITDA
and ~2.0x 2030 sales. Expensive vs. auto
but not vs. software/tech.
Growth: We forecast Tesla to sell 7.2mm
units by 2030 and grow total revenue at a
24% 8yr CAGR.
