The nomination of now-President Biden, #who opposed single-payer health care during the primary#, has put single-\n               than ever before. ##Health care policy researchers Erin C. Fuse Brown and Elizabeth McCuskey #tracked the number of unique single-payer bills# introduced in state legislatures across the country from 2010 to 201\n               the first time since 2013. In total, state legislators proposed more single-payer bills from 2017 to 2019 than in the previous seven years combined. And for 2021, we\u2019ve identified 10 single-payer bills that legislators in\n               common? They\u2019ve all universally failed. In fact, Vermont, the only state that managed to pass single-payer health care in 2011, ended up #shelving its plan three years later#.##It makes sense why single-payer advo\n               liberal states #could provide unique opportunities# to advance single-payer health care. But as I\u2019ll explain, passing single-payer health care at the state level is next to impossible, as states are particularly limited in h\n               people can opt into at the state level. #Three states# (Colorado, Nevada and Washington) have already passed a public option. It\u2019s not single-payer health care reform, but it\u2019s possible that we might see more states\n               Single-payer advocates originally envisioned a federal proposal that would cover all Americans under #a more generous version# of a preexisting program \u2014 that is, Medicare, but now for all. Doing this state-by-stat\n               that\u2019s tricky because the Department of Health and Human Services has wide discretion to approve or deny states\u2019 requests, which makes any proposal highly dependent on the national political climate. ##This isn\u2019t\n               payer systems#, while Biden\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra #has expressed more favorable sentiments#. Almost all single-payer proposals depend on these waivers and states don\u2019t often h\n               single-payer health care. Federal law #largely prevents states from regulating# employer-provided health insurance, so states can\u2019t just stop employers from offering their own health care benefits. The exact scope o\n               there\u2019s no way to get everyone onto the plan without first changing how private insurance works. States have tried to address this through measures like increasing payroll taxes or restricting providers\u2019 ability to acce\n               the cracks.##Finally, another big financial barrier is that state governments #have far less leeway than the federal government# to increase budgetary spending.
