We apply a 6.3x EV/Sales multiple on Apple's Product\nbusiness (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables) and a 6.7x EV/Sales multiple on Apple's Services\nbusiness, in-line with their respective peer groups. We also assign ~$160B of EV to Apple's\nFuture Products (AR/VR, Autos, etc.), which is driven by $21.5B of revenue and an 7.5x target\nEV/Sales multiple. This implies a 25.5x target P/E on FY24 EPS of $6.85.\n\nApple has the world's most valuable\ntechnology platform with 2.0B active\ndevices. While Apple is exposed to a\npotential slowing of consumer demand, we\nbelieve it is better positioned vs. other\nconsumer hardware names with its sticky\nuser base & history of investment through\ncycles. Tailwinds to drive a re-rating over the\nnext year include 1) new product launches\n(including rumored AR/VR launch), 2) PC\nmarket share gains on the back of M1 Macs,\n3) increasing monetization of high margin\nservices, and 4) strong cash returns. Longerterm investments in augmented reality,\npayments, health, autos and home can help\nsustain growth as Apple captures more of\nits users' time and wallet share.\n\n$170.88\n\nConsensus Price Target Distribution\n\n$122.00\n\n$214.00\n\nMS PT\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Morgan Stanley Research\n\nMean\n\nMorgan Stanley Estimates\n\nRISK REWARD CHART AND OPTIONS IMPLIED PROBABILITIES (12M)\nUSD\n\n320\n\n$230.00(+48.87%)\n$230.00\n(+48.87%)\n(+48.87%)\n\nProb (>230.00)~4.9%\n\nConsensus Rating Distribution\n\n240\n\n$175.00(+13.27%)\n$175.00\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 3000, "n": 1}}
