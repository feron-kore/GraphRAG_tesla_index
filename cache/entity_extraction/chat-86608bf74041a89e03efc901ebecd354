Nobody can think of a precedent. Some clients\nbemoan Tesla\u2019s move as upsetting customers who recently paid far higher prices\nfor the exact same car. But we've seen this before\u2026 just 110 years ago. When\nHenry Ford introduced the Model T and re-invented mass manufacturing, prices\nof automobiles declined even more sharply. I reckon someone who paid 825\nhard-earned US dollars for a Model T \u2018Runabout\u2019 in 1909 would have been\nmildly perturbed to know that a few years later, in 1913, the same model would\nsell for 40% less.\nPre-Model T cars cost around $80k (in today's dollars) on avg. Prior to the\nintroduction of the Ford Model T in 1908, gasoline-powered automobiles were\nrather limited in use and extremely expensive. In the year 1907 (the last full year\nprior to the Model T intro), there were 255 carmakers in the US (223 US-owned\nand 32 foreign, according to \u2018Motor\u2019 magazine). The average price of a gasoline\ncar at the time was $2,834, or nearly $80k in 2023 dollars. There were 43k\nvehicles produced in 1907 for an average production per carmaker of just 169\nvehicles per year.\nDeflation transformed the automotive competitive landscape and drove out\nmuch of industry. By 1929 there were 44 surviving automobile manufacturers in\nthe United States with 80% of sales accounted for by General Motors, Ford and\nChrysler.\n\nStock Rating\nIndustry View\nPrice target\nShr price, close (Jan 26, 2023)\nMkt cap, curr (mm)\n52-Week Range\n\nOverweight\nIn-Line\n$220.00\n$160.27\n$561,310\n$384.29-101.81\n\nFiscal Year Ending\n\n12/22 12/23e 12/24e 12/25e\n\nEPS ($)**\nPrior EPS ($)**\nModelWare EPS ($)\n\n4.07\n3.62\n\n3.57\n3.11\n\n4.57\n4.10\n\n5.74\n5.26\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all metrics are based on Morgan Stanley ModelWare\nframework\n** = Based on consensus methodology\ne = Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n\nMorgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with\ncompanies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

But\nhigher volumes and the moving assembly line brought far greater deflation in\nthe price of the automobile from there. The price of a Model T \u2018Runabout\u2019 fell to\n$525 by 1913 ($13.5k in today\u2019s dollars) and $395 by 1920. By 1925 the average\nprice of a Model T Runabout was $260 ($3,790 in today\u2019s dollars) which was\naround 1/20th of the average inflation adjusted price of a car in 1907.\nExhibit 2: Ford Model T 'Runabout' Cost per Unit: A Path of Deflation from 1909 to\n1925\n$900\n\n$825\n\n$800\n\nUS Dollars\n\n$700\n$600\n\n$525\n\n$500\n$395\n\n$400\n\n$260\n\n$300\n$200\n$100\n$0\n1909\n\n1913\n\n1920\n\n1925\n\nSource: Morgan Stanley Research.
