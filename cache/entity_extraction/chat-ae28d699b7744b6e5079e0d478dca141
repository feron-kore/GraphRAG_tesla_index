LLC\n\nApple, Inc. | North America\n\nErik W Woodring\n\n10-Q Analysis: B/S Inventory\nSpikes Q/Q While App Store\n(and Music) Return as Services\nDrivers\nStock Rating\n\nOverweight\n\nIndustry View\n\nIn-Line\n\nPrice Target\n\n$175.00\n\nApple's B/S inv increased Q/Q at the strongest rate in a\ndecade, reflecting the late Dec iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max ramp\nand strategic component pre-purchases. Separately, the App\nStore returned as a top 2 Services driver, while Music was a\ntop 3 Services driver for the first time in 6+ years.\nBalance sheet inventory spike reflects late December production ramp and\nstrategic component purchases. While Apple's vendor non-trade receivables (an\nindication of inventory sitting at contract manufacturers) balance fell 7% Q/Q in\nthe December quarter, B/S inventory spiked 38% sequentially, the strongest Q/Q\nB/S inventory growth in the December quarter in a decade (Exhibit 1). We believe\nthis reflects two dynamics. First, given the late December ramp of iPhone 14\nPro/Pro Max production in Zhengzhou, China, we believe Apple was likely holding\nan elevated level of finished goods inventory ending the quarter, which we'd\nexpect to get worked down in the March quarter. Second, and perhaps more\nimportantly, we believe Apple was in the market in the December quarter\nstrategically pre-purchasing commonly used components (i.e. more commoditized\nsupplies like NAND/DRAM) at favorable prices. In response to a question about\nApple's 43.5-44.5% gross margin guidance on the Dec Q earnings call, CFO Luca\nMaestri noted \"we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to\nbe able to provide this kind of guidance. And so, obviously, components are a big\npart of that\". With NAND and DRAM prices down ~25% over the last 8 months\nand ~50% over the last year, we believe commodity costs can remain a\nmeaningful gross margin tailwind for Apple into F2H23 and likely FY24.\nStructurally lower D&A remains gross margins tailwind. D&A as a percentage of\nApple's revenue continues to trend lower than historical levels, which we believe\nis a sustainable tailwind to gross margins (barring a notable ramp in capex or\nlarge acquisition). In the December Q, Apple's D&A expense of $2.9B was just\n2.5% of revenue, down from a historical average of 3.3% (2013-2021; Exhibit 2),\nwhich we estimate equates to a 10bps Y/Y tailwind to gross margins this quarter\n(Exhibit 3). While this is down from an average 110bps Y/Y tailwind to gross\nmargins in FY22, we expect the gross margin tailwind from lower D&A to lessen\n\nEQUITY ANALYST\nErik.Woodring@morganstanley.com\n\n+1 212 296-8083\n\nSabrina E Hao\nRESEARCH ASSOCIATE\nSabrina.Hao@morganstanley.com\n\n+1 212 761-3793\n\nMaya C Neuman\nRESEARCH ASSOCIATE\nMaya.Neuman@morganstanley.com\n\n+1 212 761-1946\n\nApple, Inc.
