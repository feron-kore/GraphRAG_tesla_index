To this last point, Apple's\nR&D expense in the Dec Q reached a near-record of 6.6% of revenue vs. the 3.9%\nhistorical Dec Q average (Exhibit 4) \u2013 while this was driven by R&D expense\ncoming in ~$400M more than we had forecasted, we believe this was also a\nresult of Apple's depressed Dec Q revenue base.\n\nApp Store a top 2 Services revenue driver once again, and Music a top 3 Services\ndriver for the first time. Apple's 10-Q highlights that the three largest drivers of\nServices net sales growth in the Dec Q were: 1) cloud services, 2) the App Store,\nand 3) music. Importantly, these disclosures confirm that the App Store did\nreturn to growth in the quarter after 2 quarters of flat Y/Y App Store\nperformance. We estimate App Store net revenue grew 7% Y/Y in the December\nquarter, largely a function of Apple's 14 week quarter, as the App Store would\nhave declined 1% Y/Y (MSe) if not for the 14th week. We estimate that in January,\nthe App Store continued its streak of net revenue growth (growing ~1% Y/Y)\nafter 5 consecutive months of declines last summer/fall (Exhibit 5). Additionally,\nApple Music's inclusion as a top 3 Services driver is notable as the service hasn't\nbeen a top 3 Services driver in 6+ years, which we believe partially reflects the\nearly impact of the ~10% average price increase put into effect in late October.\n\n2\n\n\fExhibits\nExhibit 1: Apple's B/S inventory was up 16% Y/Y and 38% Q/Q in the Dec Q.\nBalance Sheet Inventory ($B)\n\nY/Y Growth (RHS)\n\n$8\n\n90%\n\n$7\n$6\n5.0\n\n$5\n$4\n\n4.9\n\n4.0 13%\n3.4\n\n4.1 4.1\n4%\n3.3\n\n$3\n\n6.8\n\n-36%\n-43%\n\n70%\n\n5.9\n\n50%\n\n5.5 5.4\n4.9\n18%\n\n30%\n16%\n\n5% 5%\n\n-1%\n\n10%\n-10%\n\n-18%\n-32%\n\n-19%\n\n$2\n\n57%\n5.2\n5.0 5.2\n30%\n4.0 4.1 21%\n19%\n\n6.6\n62%\n\n-25%\n\n-30%\n\nDec-22\n\nSep-22\n\nJun-22\n\nMar-22\n\nDec-21\n\nSep-21\n\nJun-21\n\nMar-21\n\nDec-20\n\nSep-20\n\nJun-20\n\nMar-20\n\nDec-19\n\nSep-19\n\nJun-19\n\n-70%\nMar-19\n\n$0\nDec-18\n\n-50%\nSep-18\n\n$1\n\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\n\nExhibit 2: In the Dec Q, Apple's D&A was 2.5% of revenue, down from an average of 3.3%\nhistorically.\n\nApple Depreciation & Amortization as % of Revenue\nD&A as % Revenue\n\nHistorical Average (2013-2021)\n\n4.5%\n4.0%\n\n3.7%\n\n3.5%\n\n3.9%\n\n4.0%\n\n3.8%\n\n3.5%\n3.1%\n\n3.1%\n\n3.0%\n\n2.4%\n\n2.5%\n\n2.5%\n2.2%\n\n2.0%\n1.5%\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\nDec-13\n\nDec-14\n\nDec-15\n\nDec-16\n\nDec-17\n\nDec-18\n\nDec-19\n\nDec-20\n\nDec-21\n\nDec-22\n\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\n\n3\n\n\fExhibit 3: We estimate the lower run-rate of D&A as a % of revenue vs. the historical 3 year average\nresulted in a 10bps Y/Y tailwind to Dec Q gross margins.\n\nApple Gross Margin Impact from D&A\nReported Gross Margin (excluding D&A benefit)\n45.0%\n\n42.5%\n40.0%\n\n39.8%\n\n1.7%\n\n43.3%\n1.5%\n\n42.2%\n\nBenefit\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 3000, "n": 1}}
