In his first year in office, Governor Shumlin took the state one step closer to single-payer by winning the enactment of le\n               year terms) during which he continued to campaign on single-payer right up to his election to a third term. Despite all the momentum, Shumlin could not overcome several major obstacles, and the single-payer exper\n               $1.6 billion over ten years. However, there were still numerous unknowns, such as what benefits patients would receive and their specific cost-sharing requirements.#2# Once enacted, Governor Shumlin had until Ja\n               pushed ahead without a plan to pay for the legislation. \u201cWe can move full speed ahead with what we need without knowing where the money\u2019s coming from,\u201d said the Governor\u2019s special counsel for health reform.#3#\n               between payroll taxes and income taxes.

Employers wanted coverage for out-of-state employees, while small businesses were t\n               being taxed more to help others get coverage. These groups also failed to educate the public on the trade-offs a single-payer system would entail, including the huge tax increases.#Governor Shumlin said that no on\n               on the marketplace today.#9# He also agreed to consider a grace period for new taxes on small businesses, which would have reduced funding for the program by another $500 million.
