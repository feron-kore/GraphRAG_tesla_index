It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity\'s place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.\n\nTheir connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants.

Model T \'Runabout\' price in today\'s dollars declined from $24/unit in 1909 to $3,790 by 1925.\n\nIt wasn’t the automobile or even the Model T itself that moved horse drawn\ncarriages off of the road, it was innovation in manufacturing that drove dramatic\nlevels of deflation. Henry Ford introduced mass manufacturing in his Highland\nPark, Michigan factory in 1910 and his world-changing moving assembly in 1913.\nTaking nothing away from Tesla or the ever-growing number of EV players\nentering the market every month, we have not truly had the equivalent\nrevolution in high volume manufacturing for EVs at this point. Have we finally\nreached the \'step change\' in EV/Battery manufacturing? We look forward to\nseeing many of you at the Tesla Investor Day in Austin March 1st.\nTesla\'s recent price cuts move their products into mainstream car territory. Last\nnight, I comparison shopped a 2023 Tesla Model Y Long Range with a Toyota\nRAV4 Hybrid in stock at a dealership 2 miles up the road. According to Tesla’s\nwebsite, the Model Y lists for $53,490 or $45,990 including the $7,500 IRA tax\ncredit (assuming income threshold eligibility). The 2023 RAV4 Hybrid Premium\n2\n\n\x0chas an MSRP of $41,148 but is on sale for the ‘SmartPath’ price of $45,147 (like\nmany cars sold in the US recently, the dealer is charging above MSRP). The 2023\nRAV4 Hybrid Limited (41/38 mpg highway/city with 0-60mph acceleration of 5.7\nseconds) MSRP is $43,293 but sells for the ‘SmartPath’ price of $46,292. Perhaps\nif we got to the dealership we may have been able to haggle for a better price.\nPerhaps not. Toyota inventory is still so low these days.\n\nWhile it’s still early days following the Tesla price cuts, we believe history will\nreflect upon this time as the moment when changes in design, manufacturing\ntechnology, and scale enabled profound deflation in the price of EVs. Potential\nchanges to industry composition and market share may take years to play out.\nBut we believe the EV forecasts and manufacturing plans of competing EV\nplayers (startup and legacy) may potentially need to be fundamentally reconceived.\nTesla Model Y ($45,990 after $7,500 tax incentive) vs. Toyota RAV4 Hybrid ($43,293\nMSRP): Same neighborhood of price - which is better value?\n\nTesla Media Kit, Toyota, Morgan Stanley Research\n\n3\n\n\x0cH\n\nRisk Reward – Tesla Inc (TSLA.O)\n\nTop Pick\n\nBeyond EVs: Internet of Cars and Network/Software Services Optionality\nOVERWEIGHT THESIS\n\nPRICE TARGET $220.00\nOur PT of $220 is comprised of 6 components: (1) $117/share for core Tesla Auto business on\n7.2mm units in 2030, 9.0% WACC, 12x 2030 exit EBITDA multiple, exit EBITDA margin of\n20.0%.
